### 1. District Lookup by Code: 
This enables users to retrieve detailed data about a district given its code. This can be used by applications needing to present detailed district information, including geographical data, associated cities, wards, or villages, etc.

```http request
GET /api/districts/{code}
```
where `code` is the two-letter code for the district, i.e. `BT` for Blantyre.

### 2. Cities in a District: 
Retrieve a list of all cities within a specified district. This would be useful for applications related to logistics, travel planning, demographic study, or local businesses.

```http request
GET /api/districts/{code}/cities
```
where `code` is the two-letter code for the district, i.e. `BT` for Blantyre.

#### 2.1 Cities in a Region:

```http request
GET /api/regions/{code}/cities
```
where `code` is the one-letter code for the region, i.e. `S` for South, open for discussion ⚠️

### 3. Zip-Codes in a City: 
Users could access a detailed list of all wards or villages within a specific city. This can be used by government services, NGOs, or any app that requires granular data at the city level.

```http request
GET /api/cities/{city-name}/zip-codes
```
where `city-name` is the name of the city, i.e. `Blantyre`.

### 4. Search Polling Centers by Location: 
If the data includes polling centers, an API can allow users to find their nearest polling center or all centers within a district, city, ward, or location. This can be invaluable during election periods.

```http request
GET /api/polling-centers?location={location}
```
where `location` is the name of the location, i.e. `Chinyonga`.

### Constituency Information: 
Users could retrieve information about specific constituencies, including demographic data, associated cities, wards, or districts. This can be used by political campaigners, researchers, or news agencies.

### Traditional Authorities: 
Users could get information about traditional authorities in specific regions or districts. This can be useful for cultural, sociological, or anthropological research.

```http request
GET /api/district/{code}/traditional-authorities
```
where `code` is the district code

### Search by Zip-codes: 
Users could search geographic and demographic information by zip-codes. This could be used by e-commerce companies, logistics, and delivery services, among others.

```http request
GET /api/cities/{city}/{zip-code}
```
where `code` is the zip-code

### Hierarchy of Group Village Headmen: 
Provide a hierarchy of group village headmen within a specified region or district. This might be useful for social studies, anthropology research, or local government services.

```http request
GET /api/districts/{code}/group-village-headmen
```
where `code` is the district code

### Find Traditional Authority by Village or City: 
Users could find the traditional authority overseeing a specific village or city. This can be vital for anthropological research, social services delivery, or for community engagement initiatives.

### Search Polling Centers by Zip Code: 
If the data includes polling centers, an API can allow users to find their nearest polling center using a zip code. This would be particularly helpful during election times to ensure citizens know where to cast their votes.

### Retrieve Village Headmen by Zip Code or District: 
Users can find all the group village headmen in a specific zip code or district. This could be useful for social studies, local government planning, or community outreach programs.

### Get Regions by Zip Code: 
Find the overarching region that a particular zip code falls under. This can be used by government departments for regional planning or by businesses for market segmentation.

### Population Data: 
If population data is available, retrieve the population of a ward, village, city, or district. This could be crucial for public health planning, marketing research, or social services provisioning.

### Nearby Villages/Cities by Zip Code: 
Provide a list of nearby villages or cities when given a specific zip code. This could be used for logistics planning, travel services, or local search applications.

### Search Traditional Authorities by Constituency: 
Retrieve the traditional authorities that fall under a specific political constituency. This can be useful for politicians, policy makers, or social researchers.
